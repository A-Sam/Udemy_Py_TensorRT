# Udemy_Py_TensorRT

### This readme file contains pre-repositories that will have their separate README file for detail explanations

```
Following Repository provide implementation for both onnx and tensorrt python api inference.

1. Resnet 18 pretrained model either for onnx and tensorrt

2. YoloV4 pretrained Darketn with Onnx Python Inference

3. YoloV5 pretrained object detection model with Python Inference and Onnx API

4.Onnx-Inference-Yolov5 contains Tensorrt 8.5.1 Python Inference 

5. YoloV5 Video Inference describes how to implement fast inference on video frames with tensorrt library! 

6. YoloV8 folder in fact will explain how to make an fast inference on images and video frames with ONNX Dynamic API

7. Yolo P model describes implementation for ONNX API infefrence on which cars camera deteect cars around it, as well as renders instance segmentation for highway.
